# NextUpClick - Restaurant Queue Management System

## Project Overview
NextUpClick is a restaurant queue management system with a Python backend and frontend components. The system is designed to help restaurants manage their waiting lists and customer queues efficiently.

## Architecture
- `backend/`: Python-based backend service
  - `app/`: Main application package
    - `models/`: Database models and schemas
  - `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies (currently empty, needs setup)
- `frontend/`: Frontend application (structure to be implemented)


### Backend Setup
1. Key dependencies to be added in `requirements.txt`:
- Web framework (FastAPI)
- Database ORM
- Authentication library
- API documentation tools

### Frontend Setup
Frontend technology stack and setup instructions will be added as the project develops.

### Backend Patterns
- Models should be defined in `backend/app/models/`
- Database models should inherit from a common base model

## Integration Points
1. Backend-Frontend Communication
   - REST API endpoints (to be implemented)
   - WebSocket for real-time queue updates (planned)
2. Database Integration
   - SQL or NoSQL database (to be decided)
   - ORM for database interactions
